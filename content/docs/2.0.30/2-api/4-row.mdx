Row interface contains only two necessary properties: `rowId` and `cells`.
It's essential to create any grid.

| `cells`           | [`Cell`](link)`[]`                                                            | Array of `Cell` objects | 
| `height?`         | `number`                                                                      | Height of each grid row (defaultly set to 25px)  |

| `canDrop?`        | `(rowIds: `[`Id`](link)`[], position: `[`DropPosition`](link)`) => boolean`   | Callback called to check possibility to drop row on new position | 
| `onDrop?`         | `(rowIds: `[`Id`](link)`[], position: `[`DropPosition`](link)`) => void`      | Event called when rows are dropped in new position |
